The `HashRouter` component is a top level component that manages the routing of your application using [hash routing](#hash-routing).
It shares the same properties as the `Router` component, which means you can switch to it by replacing `Router` with `HashRouter`.

## Hash Routing
Hash routing is the use of the [`hash` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/hash) for application routing.
It creates URLs like `https://example.com/#/page`, while in the regular router it is `https://example.com/page`.
Hash routing is preferrable for SPAs (Single Page Applications) as it does not refresh the page.
Be aware that hash routing decreases SEO.

```tsx
import { render } from "solid-js/web";
import { HashRouter, Route } from "@solidjs/router";

const App = props => (
  <>
    <h1>Root header</h1>
    {props.children}
  </>
)

render(() => (
  <HashRouter root={App}>
    {/*... routes */}
  </HashRouter>
), document.getElementById("app"));
```
